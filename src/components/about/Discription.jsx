				I am a <b> passionate developer</b> Many things excite me in this
				expanse of technology, and I like to explore and keep my options
				open all the time. I am up for challenges that take me by surprise
				and make my head hurt. I'm comfortable working on any domain if I
				find the project is worth it. You can imagine me focused on the
				laptop screen and typing or taking down notes. Apart from technical
				things, I enjoy comics and playing cricket Now that you know me a
				bit, please feel free to drop a text because{' '}
